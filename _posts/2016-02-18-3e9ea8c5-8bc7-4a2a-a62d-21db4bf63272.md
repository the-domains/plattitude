Let's talk about ::WATER::

Water is the hot commodity of the day (the year, the century, basically forever). Those of us who live in temperate, 1st world nations generally enjoy both the heaviest dependence on clean water and the least awareness when it gets scarce, even during Droughts. In California, experiencing historic dryness, the only really remarkable thing to happen has been some lawns drying up, because when you get right down to it, the price increase of water is not catastrophic, and it's simply too mundane for most people to do anything about other than make passing remarks. We just bitch cursorily and hope for rain. Even rain won't fix it, though. We're talking about a systemic lack of urgency and collective action against climate change which is going to directly bite us in the ass (after it bites the Middle East, which will then bite us in the ass - a double ass bite.) 

Let me be clear about this in case people don't recall what I'm talking about: California has no water. It was (is?) bringing it in from other states via vampiric pipelines. We have drained our water table (deep, under the ground, we have a great deal of water under a considerable amount of pressure - because we're all sitting on it. Well, we drained it, and now we're sinking and have no way of undoing the damage. We're in for some earthquakes, we think, because of this. And we have no water. Oopsy.)

Here's some more info on our so called hero El Nino.   
And that's all for now, this is only a test post. :) Bye.
